# hosts
hosts file for blocking websites I don't like or shouldn't like.

This is intended as a really small but effective way of blocking imageboards, boorus, hentai, and other pornographic and adult-rated websites that negatively affect my life.

Add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/depwl9992/hosts/hosts as something like a PiHole adlist (updating Gravity afterward) to add these domains.

Lists to build blacklists from:
